
Pascal/MT+ GPIO Sound Module For MBC type computers

(C) D. Collins 2021

This is a simple module for driving a transistor assisted passive buzzer module
with a mbc type computer.  The specific buzzer module this is meant to support 
is a YL-44 however it should work with its many clones includeing the GPIO 
games adapter board.  This is all accomplished by rapidly switching a GPIO pin
on and off to drive a buzzer which produces a tone.  all of this is coded using
for loops and the port aray for speed.  The results even though written in Pascal 
are about the same frequency response as a loop coded in assembly language. The 
module is written without specific timeing in mind so you will have to do your 
own math to determine how many NOP iterations will produce a given tone / 
frequency. However in general:


FRQ = number of NOP to wait at high & low before re-looping

delaymax = number of iterations which are (FRQ*2 in length)

 
You should refrence your specific part's datasheet to prevent from switching it
too quickly, however i should state, even under the most stress i could put the 
buzzer, I did not manage it cause it to fail.  Obviously your milage will vary 
but even then these parts a very inexpensive if there is a issue.

 

Hooking up the Games Adapter or Buzzer:

You can atatch the signal pin of a YL-44 buzzer module to position 8 of port b 
to produce sound with this module.  The games adapter should be connectied as 
follows:

MBC Expansion Port 
GPIO GAME ADDAPTER CONN. 
UP = U DOWN = D LEFT = l 
RIGHT = R FIRE = F 
555 TRIGGER = TRG (HIGH TRIGGERS) 
555 EXPIRED = EXP (LOW = EXPIRED
                   HIGH = RUNNING) 
PASSIVE BUZZER = SND

VCC    F U D L R   GND 
 |     | | | | |   | 
+5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 GND 
 * * * * * * * * * * GPIO PORT A 
 * * * * * * * * * * GPIO PORT B 
   |           | | 
 EXP         TRG SND 

should you chage the position of the buzzer this can effect the operation of
the timer on the game adapter pay attention to specific connections so that 
there are not issues.

Symbol Defintion:

SndSetPort - <procedure>

Call this to set up GPIO B for the buzzer for the module to work.  You may 
notice that this is basically the same port set up for the timer module, This 
is done for compatiblity.


tone (frq : integer,  delaymax:integer) <procedure>

creates a tone from the buzzer the specific tone will depend on your CPU 
that is driving the module the math is as follows:

FRQ = number of NOP to wait at high & low before re-looping
delaymax = number of iterations which are (FRQ*2 in length)

I've not done alot of testing at 8mhz to speciffically determine what the 
tone frequencys are however I can say that the results are very similar 
between the Z80 and the V20 versions of the board.
